# game32
A 2D game framework for low level game development. Very much WIP.


Originally intended for the Sega Saturn, hence the 32 bit name scheme. However, this system is being implamented in a number of ways throughout it's testing. Please stay tuned for future versions on old and new platforms.

Read designDoc.txt for the full run-down.

Partial Implamentations are provided in the labeled folders.
